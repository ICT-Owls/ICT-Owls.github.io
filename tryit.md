# Try OwlSport

The website is available at [https://www.owlsport.se](https://www.owlsport.se).

## Instructions

Because OwlSport is not a finished product, we will provide a guide here to navigate the prototype.

### Accounts

To use OwlSport, you will need a user account. To simplify things, we have set up some already for you to use. For each account, the password is simply **`testing`**.

| Email              | Name             |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| erik@owlsport.se   | Erik Eriksson    |
| muhja@owlsport.se  | Muhja Aboud      |
| zach@owlsport.se   | Zacharias Eklund |
| zhkng@owlsport.se  | Zhu Kang         |
| munira@owlsport.se | Munira Regalado  |
| amy@owlsport.se    | Amy McMillan     |
| amina@owlsport.se  | Amina Negassi    |
| marco@owlsport.se  | Marco Dahl       |

### What to try

Sign in with one of the above accounts and try creating an event with some of the other accounts invited. Try opening the event and requesting carpooling. Then sign into different accounts to see what options become available to them. Currently you unfortunately cannot invite more users *after* creating the event, so be sure to invite people from the start..

## Keep in mind

### Refresh the page

Some parts of the website do not update automatically, so for example if nothing happens when you log in, just refresh the page.

### Mobile

The website is developed for a maximised browser window on a computer screen. It might not work well on mobile devices. If you want to try it from a mobile device, your browser likely has an option to view the page as a "desktop site", and it is best viewed in landscape orientation.

### Maps

Sometimes maps will not find where to place the marker for an address. In that case you can place the marker manually or try a different address.
