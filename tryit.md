# Try OwlSport

The website is available at [https://www.owlsport.se](https://www.owlsport.se).

## Instructions

Because OwlSport is not a finished product, we will provide a guide here to navigate the prototype.

### Accounts

To use OwlSport, you will need a user account. To simplify things, we have set up some already for you to use. For each all accounts, the password is simply **`testing`**.

| Email            | Name          |

| test@test.com    | Test Testson  |

## Keep in mind

### Refresh the page
Some parts of the website do not update automatically, so for example if nothing happens when you log in, just refresh the page.

### Maps
Sometimes maps will not find where to place the marker for an address. In that case you can place the marker manually or try a different address.
