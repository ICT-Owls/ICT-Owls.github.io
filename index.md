# Team Owls

## About the project

Our project is a website where the core feature is facilitating carpooling to sport events. Users will be able to create an account, register an event, and invite people to that event. Participants of the event have the option to offer to drive others to the event, or request that someone drive them to the event.  

The concept was proposed by [SolidSport](https://solidsport.com/) as something that could be integrated into their platform for broadcasting live sport events.
