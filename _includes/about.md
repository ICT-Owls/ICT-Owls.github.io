# About the project

Our project, "OwlSport", is a website where the core feature is facilitating carpooling to sport events. 

## Concept
Users can register their event, and invite other users to that event. Participants of the event have the option to offer to drive others to the event, or request that someone drive them to the event. Drivers can see a map of where they need to go. Parents can register their children, and get an update from the driver when they have arrived.

The concept was proposed by [SolidSport](https://solidsport.com/) as a prototype for something that could be integrated into their platform for broadcasting live sport events.
